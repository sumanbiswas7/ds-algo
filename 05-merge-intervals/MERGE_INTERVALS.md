# Merge intervals

This pattern describes an efficient technique to deal with overlapping intervals. In a lot of problems involving intervals, we either need to find overlapping intervals or merge intervals if they overlap.

### Insert intervals

[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/) <br/>
Question : Given a list of intervals, merge all the overlapping intervals to produce a list that has only mutually exclusive intervals. Insert newInterval into intervals such that intervals is still sorted in ascending order by starti and intervals still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).<br/>
Solution : Coming Soon !
