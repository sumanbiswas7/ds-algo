# Subsets

A huge number of coding interview problems involve dealing with Permutations and Combinations of a given set of elements. This pattern describes an efficient Breadth First Search (BFS) approach to handle all these problems.

### Subsets

[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/) <br/>
Question : Given a set with distinct elements, find all of its distinct subsets.<br/>
Solution 1: Let's say given input is `[1,5,3]` We can start with `res = [[]]` now we we'll add 1 in every array inside of res. now `res = [[],[1]]` we'll do similar process for the rest of elements in input array

```python
def subsets(nums):
    subsets = [[]]

    for n in nums:
        for i in range(len(subsets)):
            currSet = subsets[i].copy()
            currSet.append(n)
            subsets.append(currSet)

    return subsets
```

Solution 2: With a current output array we'll maintain `i` variable which will indicate our current number in nums array. for each `nums[i]` we can either add it to current output or we don't add it.

```python
def subsets(nums):

    res = []
    def backtrack(out, i):
        if i == len(nums): return res.append(out.copy())

        out.append(nums[i])
        backtrack(out, i+1)

        out.pop()
        backtrack(out, i+1)

    backtrack([], 0)
    return res
```
